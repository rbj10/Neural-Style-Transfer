# Neural-Style-Transfer
This repository demonstrates the working of Neural Style Transfer(NST), an application of CNN. NST refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, in order to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. Several notable mobile apps like Prisma use NST techniques for this purpose. Upload content and style images in the NST algorithm and play with it!!
